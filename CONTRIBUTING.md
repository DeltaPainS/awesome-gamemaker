# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to this list! Before submitting new links, please review the following in order for your links to be approved/included.

## New Links

New links **need to be related to the latest GameMaker version in some reasonable way.** This includes compatible libraries, guides, blog posts, etc. Avoid GMS1-exclusive content.
For extensions or GameMaker projects, please link an official Itch.io or repository (Github/Gitlab/etc).
For example, avoid project dumps on Google Drive that have zero version control.

Each submission should include:

- The following format: `[Awesome Example](https://github.com/username/gamemaker_library) - A short description`
- Link category.
- If it's a paid asset. ðŸ’¸
- License (if applicable)
- What sets it apart from other solutions. (if applicable)

## Creating Issues

Issues can be created for spelling/list errors, pruning dead links, or specifying if asset is now free or paid.
Authors can also ask for the removal of their content, if requested.

Suggestions for new categories, links, and better descriptions are also encouraged.
